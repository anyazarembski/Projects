# Projects
## World Happiness - October 2021
This project uses machine learning algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Randoom Forests, to predict the happiness of any given country based several variables. This project is contained in the World_Happiness.ipynb file. I did this project for my Machine Learning course using Python with Pandas and Sci-Kit Learn. 

## Movie Review Sentiment Analysis - December 2021
This project uses machine learning algorithms, principal component analysis, perceptron, multi-layer perceptron, and support vector classifier, to predict the sentiment of a given movie review. It is contained within the Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb file. This project was done for my Machine Learning course using Python, Pandas, and Sci-Kit Learn. 

## Pneumonia Detection - November 2021
This project seeks to predict whether an x-ray has pneumonia or not using computer vision though machine learning algorithms. This projects takes advamtage of keras and tensorflow to create 2D convolution layers. I did this project for my Machine Learning course and the project is housed in the Pneumonia_Detection.ipynb file. 

## 2020 Election Data - May 2021
This project was done for my Intro to R and SAS class. It uses to SAS to filter through 2020 Election Data and create several visualizations in order to compare election data based on different demographics. This was a group project in my Intro to R and SAS course and is contained in the Final_Project_Code.sas file. 

## War - April 2021
This project creates an interactive card game of the game war. It consists of the Card, Deck, and War java files. The Card and Deck files both create objects that are used in the Warfile. This project was done in my Intro to Computer Science II class, with Java. 

## Tweet List Searcher - May 2021
This project creates an interactive program that can search through a list of tweets with a keyword. It consists of the Tweet, TweetList and TweetListSearcher java files. The Tweet and TweetList files create objects that are used in TweetListSearcher to search a list of tweets for a keyword. This project was done in my Intro to Computer Science II class, with Java.
